## Cleanup Packages
### Purge uninstalled Packages

If a package is removed, it is only uninstalled, but the configuration remains on the system. This is a good thing, as you are able to reinstall the package and have it configured with the old configuration. But if you want to cleanup this old stuff, you can ge a list of uninstalled (but not purged) packages with this command:

```
dpkg --get-selections | grep 'deinstall$'
```

You can feed this list directly to apt to purge the packages:

```
apt purge $(dpkg --get-selections | grep 'deinstall$' | cut -f1)
```

### Remove Orphans

If a packages is installed, all its dependencies are also automatically installed. If the selected package is removed or the dependencies change, there can be left over packages. deborphan is an utility which searches for automatically installed but leftover packages.

First, you have to install deborpan:

```
apt install deborphan
```

Then you can get the list of orphans:

```
deborphan
```

If you want, you can even more suggestions for packages to remove:

```
deborphan --help

I'm using the â€“guess-all option which lists all orphans which deborphan can find:

```
deborphan --guess-all
```

You can feed this list directly to apt to purge the packages:

```
apt purge $(deborphan --guess-all)
```
